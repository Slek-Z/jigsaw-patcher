How to run the source code under Linux and Windows. I don't own a Mac so I don't know what do you have to do.

## Linux ##

The programs and dependencies are **python 2.6**, **gtk2**, **pygtk**, **pygobject** and **pycairo**

Any modern distro would bring it by default, otherwise just google for a howto pygtk in 0, seconds for your distro. You will probably need root access.

## Windows ##

You need some dependencies to be able to run the application. For a detailed explanation follow this [link](http://www.pygtk.org/downloads.html).

The programs and dependencies are **python 2.6**, **gtk2**, **pygtk**, **pygobject** and **pycairo**. Some useful links:
